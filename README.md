## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Schema Design**
```sql
-- Example: Projects table with comprehensive tracking
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    phase TEXT,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'Not Started',
    priority TEXT DEFAULT 'Medium',
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    progress INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
);
```

### **Real-time Collaboration**
```javascript
// Supabase real-time subscriptions for team collaboration
const subscribeToTasks = (callback) => {
    return supabase
        .channel('tasks-channel')
        .on('postgres_changes', 
            { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'tasks' }, 
            callback
        )
        .subscribe();
};
```

### **Component Architecture**
```jsx
// Example: Interactive task management component
const TaskManager = ({ projectId, tasks, onTaskUpdate }) => {
    const handleTaskComplete = async (taskId, newStatus) => {
        await supabaseHelpers.updateTaskStatus(taskId, newStatus);
        showNotification(`Task marked as ${newStatus}`);
    };
    
    return (
        <div className="space-y-2">
            {tasks.map(task => (
                <TaskItem 
                    key={task.id}
                    task={task}
                    onStatusChange={handleTaskComplete}
                />
            ))}
        </div>
    );
};
```
